  |          expected an implementor of trait `shredder::GcSafe`
  |          help: consider borrowing here: `&Scan`

  = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `shredder::GcSafe` for `NotGcSafe`
  = note: this error originates in a derive macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
